# Exercise 10.9

# Grading Guidelines:
# - No answer variable is needed. Grading script will call function.
# - Function "version1" and "version2" should both return a list with all words
# in words.txt
# 
# 1. Write a function named "version1" that reads the file words.txt 
# and builds a list with one element per word. Write a second version
# of this function named "version2" using the idiom t = t + [x]. Which 
# one takes longer to run? Why?
#
